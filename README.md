# Menger-Sponges

My models of [Menger Sponges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger_sponge) (inspired by  [Stand-up Maths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pj8_zjelDo)). Including STLs of each successuflly rendered model, a Solidworks drawing and OpenSCAD code which can successfully render up to a level 4 sponge.

 OpenSCAD can technically preview the level 5 sponge with not very long a delay, but I have yet to find out how much time it would take for it to render/produce an STL of it. Level 4 took ~65 minutes to render into an STL-able model in OpenSCAD. I managed to create a level 5 in Solidworks by slow piecemeal patterning, but am not sure where that model went.
